Eight months ago, the client was getting out of his car with the intention of walking his dog. At that moment, a man opened his gate from the backyard, and two unleashed pit bulls came running toward him and his dog. The entire incident lasted approximately three minutes.

While attempting to pull his dog away, the other pitbull bit him on his left hand. Another individual came to his aid, but the client does not remember their name.

Before the accident, the client enjoyed good health, but now he finds it difficult to bend down and is plagued by intense and persistent back pain. Additionally, his hand experiences numbness, and has struggles to stand without assistance. This has led to the client missing work, resulting in a substantial loss of income. The range of physical impairments he is grappling with has had a profound impact on his overall well-being and daily life. *Client insurance ?

Michael went to get the door for Wife, he stepped onto the ground, slipped and fell presumable because they hadn?t properly cleaned up the snow and ice. He hit the truck rail on their Tahoe. He already has balancing issue because he is recovering from spinal fusion surgery a month ago. He went straight down, the wife got out of the car, and she was slipping and sliding everywhere trying to get to him. She was screaming for help, he had hit his head, he was barely making sense or sounds. She asked if he could get up but he could not move. The ice was horrible. There was a man who had just parked and he went to help them and brought back help. Wife was trying to keep him conscious and warm, then two nurses came up and rubbed his legs trying to wake him up but he was not responding, initially. They put the e-collar on his neck, got a stretcher up in 5-10 mins, took about 10 people to get him on the stretcher because they were all slipping - they had to take him through the parking lot down to the ER due to issues with the closest elevator (it was too small for a stretcher). At that time, she had to separate from him to deal with her seizure surgery. Discharged last night. He is a police officer. He was recovering from a spinal fusion surgery when all of this happened and he ended up breaking a completely new disk. Discharge plan - He can?t do anything with his concussion. His back has to be treated like any other broken bone - he can?t do anything, no PT yet - not eligible to do anything yet in limbo waiting to do PT. Michael does have attorney Mike Mulvey handling his Retirement Disability. He is, of course, not currently represented for this matter.",General Injury,Slip and Fall,Tier 5

The client and his girlfriend were riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle last Saturday at around 1 am when they got into a heated argument with an individual who was accompanying them. As a result, a pursuit involving the police ensued. During the pursuit, the client's motorcycle fell over, resulting in the client sustaining abrasions and scrapes on his shoulder and knuckles, while his girlfriend suffered scratches on her wrist. Both individuals were then transported to Laconia Hospital, which was approximately a 3-hour journey from the location of the accident. The client suspects that the incident may have been orchestrated intentionally, as they possess video evidence showing the involvement of six officers from the Franklin Police Department. However, the police have been uncooperative and have not provided any information about the incident. Following the accident, the client underwent two brain surgeries but unfortunately did not recover and slipped into a coma on Saturday afternoon. In order to gather more information and seek justice, the family is in need of an attorney.

The client had been walking to the customer's house and was greeted by the customer's dog upon arrival. When the client went outside to get his tools, the dog was also outside and heading toward the client's truck. It was during this encounter that the dog bit the client, causing a snapped finger and a laceration on the client's middle finger. The dog was on a leash but had free range of the garage and driveway area. The client managed to retrieve the dog, and the customer provided a towel to help stop the bleeding. However, the client began to feel dizzy, and the customer assisted him in sitting down. The client sustained a dog bite on his right hand and was able to call his employer, who promptly sent him to an urgent care facility. At the urgent care center, the doctor informed the client that it might take 2-3 weeks for a full recovery and was uncertain if the employer would consider it medical leave. However, the client was advised that he could potentially work on light duty during this period to avoid missing work.

The client provided a description he wanted reviewed of what happen. The client is not represented for the PI and is in contact with the insurance company of the party that caused the accident. Law enforcement was involved. Client wrote: July 5th, we were anchored at lake Santa Barbara with approximately 12 other boats that were also anchored. My lights were all on as required when you are anchored at night. The red and green lights were on and white light at the stern and all the blue and white lights in the inside of the boat were on including the dashboard and stereo lights. The boat was lit up brightly. At approximately 12:45 am July 5th, I was awakened by a very large jolt and crashing sound from your insured Elias Mojica. I was jerked back and then thrown forward out of my seat and face down on the deck of the boat, my head was slammed face first, suffered a severe concussion as my medical records show. My neck and back from Elias Mojica hitting my boat at excessive speed in a no wake zone caused injuries. I have all the medical records from North Broward Medical Center. I am Currently being treated at TOTALMD Chiropractic and Physical Therapy from my neck and back trauma from the accident. Your insured Elias Mojica fled the scene after hitting my boat. Then he decided to turn around and drove away again, then turned again for a second time and yelled to me from a distance ?what is your name and phone number? I yelled back to him my name and phone number. He said he would text me his insurance information right away, which he did not. I received a text message from him July 6th at approximately 11:30am. The text message stated ? ?I?m contacting you about the boat incident? I returned the text requesting his insurance information no response. I then approximately 2 hours later called him. He said, ?I will pay for the damages to your boat, I?d rather not go through my insurance company?. Then I asked him, please tell me the name of your insurance carrier, he was very evasive, I asked for his boat registration, name address etc., he responded I don?t have that available right now, I again asked please just tell the name your insurance company, he finally told me I have Progressive insurance. I called Progressive and filed a claim. Progressive opened up a claim, an adjuster contacted me, the process was in motion, Progressive issued me a claim number, 3 days later, I received a call from Eldress Rodriquez Claims Manager for Progressive, notifying me Elias Mojica only has car insurance with us, he finally disclosed his boat was insured with Chubb Insurance. That is why I finally contacted you Chubb insurance. I also have the claim number from Progressive insurance showing he was not truthful about his boat insurance. He wasted my time and progressive time being not truthful. Immediately after the incident he proceeded to flee the scene after hitting my boat, without checking if were injured or needed help. It was apparent he was under the influence; it was obvious his abilities to operate the vessel were compromised, Due to his erratic 0peration of the boat he then fled the scene again. I then called Broward County Sheriffs reporting the hit and run., they asked me could I manage to meet an officer at the sea wall at Lake Santa Barbara Park. The officer was flashing a light for me to tie up at sea wall that I managed to get to. The officer inspected the boat, started a police report, gave me a card with a case number. I was told the Florida Wildlife Commission would call first thing in the morning at 8:30am. I received a phone call from Florida Wildlife Commission (FWC) from Officer Devon Davis at 8:30am sharp on July 5th. He told me to meet him at the Pompano Beach Boat ramps at 9:30am. We met with officer for approximately 2 hours, he did a complete investigation and inspection, interviewed my passenger and myself, my passenger Robert Teel gave a complete sworn witness statement. The officer advised both of us to seek immediate medical attention, whereas we went directly to West Broward County Medical Center when the officer investigation was completed. My passenger and myself spent 5 hours in the emergency room, I suffered a severe concussion, Neck and back injuries, hip injury, dental injury whereas a lower left dental implant stem was Knocked out. I hope this helps you, Johnathon. Melanie thinks this will help things move along much more quickly. If you need any reports from me let me know or you can call the agency?s that took them. If you have any questions about the boat, please contact your marine surveyor that you sent. (Allister Dredge) I am very disappointed the way Elias Mojica acted; I take boat safety very seriously this could have been Fatal. I hope this is very helpful so we can get this taken care of quickly it has been going on a long time.",General Injury,Automobile Accident,Tier 2

April 25, 2023, was the first surgery, Emergency surgery was done on May 1st, and the harmonic tool was done on May 18. Location of Incident ? Lewis Burg PA Liability ? The client underwent surgery on her stomach. Upon waking up after the surgery, she experienced pain in her stomach. Additionally, she consistently felt bloating and nausea after eating. She expressed her symptoms to the staff and doctor, but they dismissed it as a temporary effect of the anesthesia from the surgery. Despite her concerns, the client was discharged. However, she noticed that her stomach was getting larger, resembling a seven-month pregnancy. Concerned, she went to the ER, where the staff suspected she might be pregnant. However, the client believed it was due to her initial surgery. She underwent a CT scan, but after reviewing the results, she was sent back for another CT scan. She underwent multiple CT scans. The client also mentioned that she had been vomiting before being rushed to the hospital, leading the medical team to consider pregnancy as a possibility. However, after reviewing the CT scan results, the doctor informed her that she had fluid and bacteria in her stomach area.

Misdiagnosis/med neglect led to regrowth of Meningioma in the brain and now it is not operable Surgery ? no Date of Incident: 3/16/2023 Facility/Company: Penn State Hospital / Dr. Lucasen/ Dr. Twinman/ Dr. Ashley Location of Incident: Hershey, Pennsylvania Liability: In 2009, CL had a brain surgery through ALGH Hospital; in 2013, she was diagnosed with MS; and in 2015, she switched to Penn State Hospital to monitor the regrowth of the Meningioma in her brainstem and MS. Every six months, an MRI was done. Until recently, CL had issues with her shoulder, so she had both MRIs done at ALGH, and was informed about the regrowth of her Meningioma. After receiving results from ALGH, CL took the results back to Penn State. The neurosurgeon showed all results from the past 8 years and informed her of the tumor regrowth in a different location, but results were not stated on all radiology reports. The client has been informed that it is not operable and that radiation would be required, so CL completed radiation. Today CL had follow-up  and was informed the Meningioma did not grow, but it did not shrink with radiation, and if it continues to grow, CL will suffer cognitive issues and paralysis, and if it reaches a point where an operation has to be done, it will be dangerous. Damage: Due to Penn State Hospital's negligence, the results of every MRI done for the past 8 years did not include the regrowth of the Meningioma in a different place in the CL brain. CL was not made aware and now, it is too late for it to be operable. If it continues to grow, the CL is more than likely to suffer from cognitive issues and paralysis. If it reaches a point where an operation is needed, it will be life or death. The client claims that if results were in the report, it could have been operable at an early stage and is looking to get compensated for the damage.",Wrongful Death,Medical Malpractice,Tier 3

Back in 2021, the client went to the hospital with a complaint of chest pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospital conducted some tests but did not find any COVID-related symptoms. However, they did discover a mass in his left kidney. Surprisingly, the hospital released the client without providing any information or prescribing any medication. His primary doctor was also unaware of the situation. In 2023, the client returned to the same hospital due to the same chest pain. During this visit, the ER doctor informed him about the growth of the mass in his kidney, which had become dangerous. The hospital referred him to the urology department, where they decided to remove the entire kidney due to the severity of the mass. The client believes there was negligence on the hospital's part, as they never informed him about the mass in his kidney during the previous visit and did not provide proper treatment. Damages- The client lost his left kidney due to the failure to treat the mass back in 2021. He was not aware of the condition and the risks involved, which led to the need for kidney removal.

The surgery intended to alleviate the condition ended up causing sharp and persistent nerve pain.

Yes Facility Name- Lehigh Valley Cedarcrest Hospital Dr Name ? Dr. Walter Jean Date of Incident- 8/8/2023 Location- PA Liability ? The client faced a multitude of health challenges, including issues related to speech and swallowing, as well as a shoulder injury. Her journey began when she was diagnosed with Eagle syndrome, which prompted a hospital visit. During her hospital stay, the doctor admitted to a surgical mistake and disclosed that a left intracranial Styloidectomy had gone awry. Furthermore, the client alleged that she was placed in restraints, resulting in a shoulder injury. The client strongly believes that if the initial surgery had been conducted correctly, she would not be grappling with permanent injuries. However, the doctor informed her of the procedural error only a month later and directed her to consult an Ear, Nose, and Throat (EENT) specialist, while refusing to provide further treatment. Damages- The damages incurred by the client in this case have far-reaching implications, affecting both her physical well-being and financial stability. The burden of mounting medical bills has been placed squarely on the client's shoulders, with insurance covering some but not all expenses. This has led to significant out-of-pocket costs that she must bear. Physically, the client has suffered from speech and swallowing issues, as well as a debilitating shoulder injury that renders her unable to use her left arm. This injury has severely impacted her mobility, making everyday tasks challenging and hindering her ability to work. Consequently, she has missed several weeks of work intermittently and, when attempting to return, continues to face challenges that force her to call off due to her injuries. These injuries have placed immense financial strain on the client, making it difficult for her to sustain her livelihood. The combination of mounting medical bills, lost income from missed work, and the inability to perform daily tasks without difficulty has created a significant financial burden, exacerbating the client's overall distress and emphasizing the necessity of a comprehensive resolution to address both her health and financial well-being.",General Injury,Medical Malpractice,Tier 3

The client is employed as a union labor contractor, working seasonally. He was rehired in May 2023. While performing his duties, the client sustained an injury. The client stated, he was pouring concrete and lifting a heavy beam when he twisted his back and injured his lower back.

No Date of Incident- 9/11/2023 Location- MI Liability ? The client has been experiencing discomfort in his back, specifically in the lower back region. The client underwent two weeks of X-ray examinations to determine the cause of the issue. During this time, he had to rely on a wheelchair to move around. The case involves a series of 100 blow tests, which are intended to help determine what happened and potentially identify the root cause of the client's health issues. It's worth noting that the client's regular work involves driving for appliance deliveries, and the incident occurred while he was lifting a fridge with a fellow employee. It's important to highlight that there were no lifting machines available, and the physical strain of this task resulted in pain in both the lower back and head. The client also experienced dizziness, cramps in both feet and frequent headaches. In response to these health concerns, the client sought medical attention from his doctor. One significant concern is that the employer did not cover any of the client's medical expenses, leaving the client with the impression that their well-being is not a priority for the company. Damages- The damages suffered by the client are multi-faceted and have had a profound impact on various aspects of his life. Firstly, there is a significant loss of income due to missing work for a total of one week, coupled with the ongoing uncertainty regarding their ability to return to work in the near future. This financial strain has disrupted his financial stability and immediate financial responsibilities. Moreover, the client's mobility has been severely impacted. The client is currently unable to walk and requires the use of a wheelchair for mobility. This loss of mobility stems from nerve-related issues in their lower back, which not only cause physical discomfort but also contribute to his reliance on the wheelchair. Additionally, the accumulation of medical bills further compounds the client's challenges. The need for ongoing medical treatment and potential rehabilitation adds to the financial strain they are facing.
